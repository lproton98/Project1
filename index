		<h2>Quick Bio</h2>
			<p>I was born in Lansing, Michigan to German parents and spent most of my childhood between New Mexico in the USA and Nordrhein-Westfalen over the summers in Germany. My family (parents, one sister, and our cat) moved to Tennessee in 2011 where I graduated high school in 2016. I spent a year working at an elementary school through City Year in Philadelphia, and then came to the great city of Chicago to pursue my undergrad.
